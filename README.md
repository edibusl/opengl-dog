# opengl-dog

This is an educational OpenGL project that creates a scene with a dog inside a room using raw OpenGL functions.
<br>
The scene includes also textures, different light sources (ambient and spotlight) and special material configurations.
<br>
All light sources and also the dog position can be controlled using the keyboard.
<br>
Camera can also be controlled and moved inside/outside of the room.
<br>
Furthermore, the camera can be placed inside the dog's eyes - all matrix calculations are done manually.
