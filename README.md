# opengl-dog

This is an educational OpenGL project that creates a scene with a dog inside a room using raw OpenGL functions.
The scene includes also textures, different light sources (ambient and spotlight) and special material configurations.
All light sources and also the dog position can be controlled using the keyboard.
Camera can also be controlled and moved inside/outside of the room.
Furthermore, the camera can be placed inside the dog's eyes - all matrix calculations are done manually.
